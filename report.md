# Machine learning mini-project : French-English translation

Report by **[LÃ©o Seguin](https://github.com/leoseguin)**

## Introduction

Language translation plays a vital role in our society, by easing access to information in diverse languages. This project focuses on the development of a machine translation model to perform English-to-French and French-to-English translation tasks. For this purpose, we will create a model in PyTorch and train it on the cleaned dataset defined [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/prepare-french-english-dataset-machine-translation/).

This report discusses the methodology used for the project, including the dataset used for training and evaluation, the neural network model employed, and the outcomes of our experiments.
